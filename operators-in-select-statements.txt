EXERCISES

////// 1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.
   SELECT * 
      //This selects all columns
   SELECT col-1, col-2
      //This selects the columns whose id matches "col-1" and "col-2"


////// 2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.

   - SELECT / FROM / WHERE
      - So Forrest Walked.

   - SELECT / FROM / ON / WHERE / GROUP BY / HAVING / ORDER BY
      - So Forrest Oftened Walked. Gump Heads Off.


////// 3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

   // Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.
      SELECT name, gender, age
      FROM dogs
      WHERE breed LIKE 'labrador%'
         OR breed LIKE '%labrador';

   // Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.
      SELECT id
      FROM dogs
      WHERE age < 1;

   // Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.
      SELECT name, age
      FROM dogs
      WHERE gender = 'F'
         AND weight > 35;

   // Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.
      SELECT *
      FROM dogs
      WHERE breed NOT LIKE 'shepherd%'
         OR breed NOT LIKE '%shepherd';

      SELECT id, age, weight, breed
      FROM dogs
      WHERE weight > 60
         OR breed = 'great danes';


////// 4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?
   // SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;

      name     | adoption_date
      ---------+--------------
      Mushi    | 2016-03-22
      Seashell | NULL
      Azul     | 2016-04-17
      Victoire | 2016-09-01
      Nala     | NULL


   // SELECT name, age FROM cats;

      name     | age
      ---------+--------------
      Mushi    | 1
      Seashell | 7
      Azul     | 3
      Victoire | 7
      Nala     | 1


////// 5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
   // Display all the information about all of the available cats.
      SELECT *
      FROM cats;

   // Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.
      SELECT name, gender
      FROM cats
      WHERE age = 7;

   // Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.
      SELECT name
      FROM cats;


////// 6. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.

   < less than:
      E.g. Selling alcohol to minor in the U.S. whose age is less than 21.

   > greater than:
      E.g. If the temperature rises greater then 212 degrees F, the the water will boil.

   <= less than and equal to:
      E.g. The clearance height for vehicles under the overpass can be less than and equal to 12 feet.

   >= greater than and equal to:
      E.g. The minimum driving age in the U.S. is greater than or equal to 16.

   != <> not equal to / greater than or less than: 
      E.g. If the light is not equal to red, you may proceed.

   = equal to:
      E.g. If the timer equals 20 minutes, your baked cookies are finished.

   LIKE : Used to search for specific queried patterns in a column.
      E.g. Search for all titles where the word "president" is used.

   NOT LIKE : Used in search to exclude query[s] from results.
      E.g. Search for all students that did not recieve an F on the paper.


////// 7. From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?
